Entity chunk rules:						
	Two phase extraction:					
	1. Candidate selection:					
		Noun chunks detected by SpaCy: phrases of which the noun is the head of a phrase				
	2. entities unlikely to be a class/individual name rejection:
	   if selected candidate contains words: type, kind, category, difference, extent or their plurals
	3. Manual verification of the quality (because of imperfect models the tools use)
